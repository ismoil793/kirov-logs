You might have seen such a Javascript file containing _**use strict;**_ on top

```js
"use strict";
```
It is quite an important statement which makes a Javascript to run in a strict mode

It is very handy to get rid of potential bugs, let's take a look to some examples


```js
myVariable = 10
console.log(10)
```
It is just going to log `10` with no errors, even thogh we didn't use var, let or const keywords

```
10
```

However, if you use the strict mode like this:
```java
"use strict";

myVariable = 10
console.log(10)

// Result:
Uncaught ReferenceError: myVariable is not defined
```

Without strict mode being used you can do really weird things with Javascript
```js
undefined = "defined"
```
Value of **undefined** won't be changed because it **is ready only**, but it won't also print any errors

```java
"use strict";

undefined = "defined"

// Result:
Uncaught TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'undefined'
```

Let's also have a look to the following script:

```javascript

function combine(x, x, z) {
    return [x, x, z]
}

console.log(combine(1,2,3))

// Result:
[2,2,3] // because value of x is overwritten
```

It is just meaningless to redifine a function parameter

```java
"use strict";

function combine(x, x, z) {
    return [x, x, z]
}

console.log(combine(1,2,3))

// Result:
Uncaught SyntaxError: Duplicate parameter name 
not allowed in this context
```



> Good news for those who use `module exports and imports`, because they use the strict mode by defautl.
Moreover, class definitions will also use the strict mode.
